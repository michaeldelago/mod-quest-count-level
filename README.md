# Quest Count Level

This AzerothCore module allows you to quest *only* through leveling, where a number of quests gives the character an item that levels them up. 

The goal is to have a more "smoothed out" questing experience, where each level takes roughly the same amount of time. Additionally, this lets the player stay a certain level and collect level up tokens for as long as they like, as long as the quests are level-appropriate.

The default configuration of this module depends on [mod-item-level-up](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-item-level-up) currently, but you can swap out the item with any item, if you'd like. 

Install in the standard method:

1. `git clone https://github.com/michaeldelago/mod-quest-count-level.git modules/mod-quest-count-level`

2. Install sql file in sql/characters/
